# Data Science Workflows

The purpose of the data science workflows is both to provide Data Scientists in the AICoE with a template for structuring their projects and to offer data science users an opportunity to learn more about data science on ODH. We want to encourage a consistent workflow across projects that promotes the Operate First approach by testing and taking advantage of the capabilities developed by the AICoE. Additionally, as data scientists focused on developing intelligent applications for the cloud, we must ensure we are working from a cloud-native data science mindset from the start.
